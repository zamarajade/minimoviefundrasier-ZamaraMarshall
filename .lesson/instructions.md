You have decided to raise money for your local rowing club by hosting a movie night, you have been able to book a 150-seat theatre and gain early access to the next big blockbuster. You are planning to sell tickets and to entice people to buy a ticket, each ticket will include a lucky number.  If the lucky number is selected, that person will win a prize on the night.  

To manage the ticket sales and work out the profits, you have decided to create a Python program.  You have access to a spreadsheet with some sample data but need a quick way to issue tickets and record attendee details.  You can assume that all tickets are fully paid for when they are bought.The movie is for ages 12 and up. Ticket prices are on the spreadsheet in the google classroom.
